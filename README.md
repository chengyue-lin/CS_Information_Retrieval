How to run our code:


The crawler is done by Xianghu Wang. The elasticsearch part is done by Chengyue Lin.    
And both of us work together to finish the extend part.
            

Part 1:    


Part 2:   

For the elasticsearch part, we use the local machine to run it. We create and set up the index.  
And we put the data (.json) file into the elasticsearch. User can input what query they want to search inside our index.  
We just write a match function to find which URL is match with query.   

Part 3:
